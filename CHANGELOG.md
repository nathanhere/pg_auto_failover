### pg_auto_failover v1.3.1 MOD (June 11, 2020) ###

* Updated various getopt_long calls based on changes observed by RekGRpth in repo https://github.com/RekGRpth/pg_auto_failover. This change supposedly fixed the bug in the Alpine based images that would not recognize pg_autoctl options as valid. This branch is based on a fork of the Citus pg_auto_failover repo as seen on April 24, 2020. This is an attempt to build from this branch because (suspected) something in the latest package manager in Citus pg_auto_failover v1.2 seems to have broken functionality (Docker images built on this date work flawlessly).
